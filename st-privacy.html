  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 3, 2025</p>

  <p>StrikeSystem respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data is collected and how it is used:</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collected</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Guild (Server) IDs:</strong> Used to store configuration, allowed roles, and log channels.</li>
    <li><strong>Moderation Logs:</strong> Records of strikes, warnings, mutes, bans, and reasons.</li>
    <li><strong>User IDs:</strong> Stored for moderation tracking (strikes, warnings, mutes, bans).</li>
    <li>No personal Discord user data (such as email, IP address, or private messages outside of subscribed DMs) is
      stored.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Data Use</h2>
  <p>Data is used <strong>only</strong> to enable moderation features and to keep logs of moderation actions. Data is
    not shared, sold, or used for advertising.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Data is stored securely in the Bot’s database. If the Bot is removed from a server, the associated data will not be
    deleted by default.</p>

  <h2>4. DM Forwarding</h2>
  <p>If users subscribe via <code>%subscribedms</code>, their DMs from server members are forwarded to the designated
    moderators. Users can unsubscribe at any time.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Bot interacts with Discord’s API to fetch server and user information. Their use is subject to Discord’s
    policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://discord.com/privacy">Discord Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>These terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the Bot after updates constitutes acceptance of the
    new terms.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions, concerns, or data deletion requests, please join the Support Server.</p>
