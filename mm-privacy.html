  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 3, 2025</p>

  <p>MemberMessenger respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data is collected and how it is used:</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collected</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Guild (Server) IDs:</strong> Used to store configuration (prefix, autoresponses, scheduled messages,
      etc.).</li>
    <li><strong>Autoresponse Keywords/Responses:</strong> Stored for use within the server where they were created.</li>
    <li><strong>Scheduled Messages:</strong> Stored until they are delivered or removed.</li>
    <li><strong>Channel IDs:</strong> Stored to know where to send scheduled or automated responses.</li>
    <li>No personal Discord user data (such as email, IP address, or message history) is stored.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Data Use</h2>
  <p>Data is used <strong>only</strong> to enable features such as autoresponses, scheduled messages, and member/server
    info. Data is not shared, sold, or used for advertising.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Data is stored securely in the Bot’s database. If the Bot is removed from a server, the associated data will not be
    deleted by default.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Removal</h2>
  <p>Server administrators may remove stored data at any time using commands like <code>/removeautoresponse</code> or
    <code>/removescheduledmessage</code>. Complete data deletion can be requested via the Support Server.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Bot interacts with Discord’s API to fetch server and user information. Their use is subject to Discord’s
    policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://discord.com/privacy">Discord Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>These terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the Bot after updates constitutes acceptance of the
    new terms.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions, concerns, or data deletion requests, please join the Support Server.</p>
