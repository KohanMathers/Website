  <h1>Terms of Service (TOS)</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 3, 2025</p>

  <p>By using StrikeSystem (“the Bot”), you agree to the following Terms of Service:</p>

  <h2>1. Use of the Bot</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Bot is provided “as-is” without guarantees of uptime, accuracy, or availability.</li>
    <li>You must comply with Discord’s <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> and <a
        href="https://discord.com/guidelines">Community Guidelines</a>.</li>
    <li>Abuse of the Bot (e.g., spamming commands, attempting to exploit, or using moderation powers maliciously) may
      result in removal of access.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Server Permissions</h2>
  <p>Certain commands (e.g., <code>%setup</code>, <code>%strike</code>, <code>%mute</code>, <code>%ban</code>) require
    administrator permissions or specifically allowed roles. You are responsible for granting these permissions
    carefully.</p>

  <h2>3. Moderation Actions</h2>
  <p>The Bot records all moderation actions (strikes, warnings, mutes, bans) in the designated log channel. The Author
    is not responsible for the content or decisions of moderators.</p>

  <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>The Author (Kohan Mathers) is not responsible for any damages, losses, or issues caused by using the Bot. Use is at
    your own risk.</p>

  <h2>5. Termination</h2>
  <p>Access to the Bot may be revoked at any time for violation of these terms or at the Author’s discretion.</p>
