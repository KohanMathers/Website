                <p>Hello, I'm Kohan, a young developer currently pursuing my education in the digital realm. I'm fluent in programming languages like Python and HTML, which form the foundation of my skills. In my free time, I've been researching and developing third-party plugins for apps such as Cisco Packet Tracer. My portfolio showcases some exciting projects where I've applied my skills, each project from a later date than the previous one, showing how my skills have developed over time. While I'm still in the early stages of my career and haven't yet gained professional experience, I'm focused on my long-term goals, with aspirations in cybersecurity and plugin development.</p>

                <p>I'm fluent in the following programming languages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>Lua</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>

                </ul>
                <p>On top of these, I am also proficient in many Microsoft programs, as well as apps such as Cisco Packet Tracer. I also have the ability to learn and pick up any programming language/program very quickly. For example, I learned most of Microsoft Access within an hour of using it.</p>

                <p>My current projects involve developing a Quality of Life (QoL) plugin for Cisco Packet Tracer, which aims to enhance user experience and add additional functionalities to the software. Additionally, I'm working on developing test software for drones using Microsoft AirSim, a realistic simulator for drones, cars, and more. These projects are both time-consuming and challenging, but they are incredibly rewarding as they allow me to apply my programming skills in real-world scenarios.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the skills I am learning through these projects are invaluable as they will forever help me in my future career. From problem-solving and critical thinking to software development and project management, I am constantly improving and expanding my skill set. I believe that the experiences gained from these projects will pave the way for future opportunities and contribute to my growth as a developer.</p>
